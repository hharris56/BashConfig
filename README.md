# Bash Configuration

## Introduction
After using bashrc files found online for a while I got tired of scrolling
through lots of settings I didnt understand. This prompted a desire to create
my own robust bashrc that would be minimal and easier to comprehend. I also
thought I could use this opportunity to familiarize myself with bash / git 
standards, and create a git repo so I could easily transfer settings between 
different machines.

## Structure

### .bashrc
The starting point for configuring my bash instance, this script calls
all associated resources to setup bash.

### .bash_aliases
Houses all aliases used in my bash instance. NOTE: Some of the aliases
will not work because the assosiated programs are not installed, or the 
specified file paths do not exist.

### .bash_prompts
Custom prompts designed to make interacting with the terminal more enjoyable,
whether that is comfort, speed, charm, or all 3.

### .profile
TODO: Write description
